<h1 align="center">ðŸŽ£ My Phishing Case - ABBank ðŸŽ£</h1>

## I.The price to pay for laziness.

After the success of the Phishing campaign targeting SeaBank, I was assigned the task of launching the next Phishing campaign against ABBank. However, as described, I suffered two consecutive failures in this campaign due to my laziness.
In Phishing campaigns, reconnaissance of AV, EDR solutions, etc., is mandatory. You can use Google Dorking to search for leaked solution policies, or identify specific public agents for certain EDR and AV solutions, or simply leverage resources from previous Red Team campaigns. After that, setting up and testing locally is crucial. Unfortunately, in this campaign, I completely skipped all these fundamental steps ðŸ˜ƒ.
